## Division Task

You are given a number **N**. Let us say the [floor](https://www.hackerrank.com/external_redirect?to=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/floor) of 32 divided by **N** is **x**

Print as per following rules

- In case x is 0, print "Too Low"
- In case it is not possible to generate a valid number, print -1
- In all other cases, print x

1.There are two possibilities when N is 0 it is not possible to generate a possible number hence print -1,

2.Else find  x = 32/N and check against value of x if it is 0 print corresponding statement else all other will be printed in else statement.
