### Identify Prime

A Prime number is a number that is divisible only by itself and 1.(it should have only two positive factors)

The natural thought comes into our mind is to find are there any factors for the given number along with 1 and itself.If it is true it is not prime or else we can say it is prime.And on exemption for this is 1 is not a prime.

Let us take an example:

n = 7

start checking from 2 to till that number

Is 7% 2 is 0 ? no ,now check 3 is 7%3 is 0? no continue this till 6 and return "Yes" if you dont find any factors other than two  else resturn "No".
