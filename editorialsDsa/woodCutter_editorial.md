- Given 
- n - number of trees
- m - required wood
- arr - the height of n trees.
- Keep lo = 0, hi = last element of the array
- while lo <=hi
  - find mid = (lo+hi)/2 //
  - check is it possible to get required amount if sawblade is put at mid position
    - keep varibale ans = mid
    - and lo = mid+1
  - else
    - hi = mid-1
  - return ans
- //function to check is it possible to get required amount if sawblade is put at mid.
- keep sum = 0
- for all the tree heights
  - if current height is > mid
    - sum = sum + current height -mid
  - if sum >= m
    - return true
