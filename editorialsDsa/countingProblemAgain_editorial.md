## Counting Problem Again                                       

- Create an empty object
- Run a loop over the given  string 
  -  check if the current element of array already exists in the object as a key.
    - If it does not exists make its value as 1 
  - else(i.e already exists) 
    - increment the count of the value.
- For every key in object
  - print key along with its value.
