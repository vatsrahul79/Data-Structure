##                 Count Names                                            

The approach here is making given strings as keys and number of occurrences as its value

- Declare an empty object
- Run a loop over the given array of strings 
- check if the current element of array already exists in the object as a key.
  - If it does not exists make its value as 1 
- else(i.e already exists)
  -  increment the count of the value.
