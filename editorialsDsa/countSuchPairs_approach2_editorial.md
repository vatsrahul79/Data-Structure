- Given n , target  and array A
- Keep an object to find the frequency of all element
- keep count = 0
- for every element of A
  - var req = target-A[i]
  - if obj[req] exists
    - count +=obj[req]
  - if req = A[i] //this will take care of duplicates
    - count--
- print count/2(because we have counted for every element but we need number of pairs)
