## Your First Maze Problem

1. Imagine the maze as X-Y plane and the person's initial position is at the origin
2. Whenever he moves Up he is moving along positive Y direction similarly  he moves Down he is moving along the negative Y direction 
3. Similarly for R positive X-direction and for L negative X-direction
4. Declare x and y variables taking 0 as initial value .
5. Run a loop and check if current character  is "L" decrement x by 1 ,if it is "R" increment x by 1,if it is "U" increment y by 1 else if it is  "D" decrement y by 1.
6. Once the loop is over Print x,y values.
