## Again a classical problem

- Declare a character stack S.
- Now traverse the expression string exp.
  - If the current character is a starting bracket (**‘(‘ or ‘{‘ or ‘[‘**) then push it to stack.
  - If the current character is a closing bracket (**‘)’ or ‘}’ or ‘]’**) then pop from stack and if the popped character is the matching starting bracket then fine else parenthesis are not balanced.


- After complete traversal, if there is some starting bracket left in stack then “not balanced”
