## Catch that 420!
1. Declare a boolean variable taking initial value as false.
2. Run a loop through the given string of characters from index i=0 to i=stringlength-2(excluding)
3. Now check if the ith character is equal to "4",i+1th character is equal to "2" and i+2th character is equal to "0"
4. If that condition is met make boolean variable to true and break the loop. (because you caught "420")

5. Now check if the boolean variable is true print "Caught" else print "Escaped"
