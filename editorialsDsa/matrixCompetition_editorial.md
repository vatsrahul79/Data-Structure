### Matrix Competition

You are given two matrices (2D array). The first array **A** (**n** rows and **m** columns) and second array **B** (**i** rows and **j** columns).

Output sum of the matrix which is greater than the sum of another matrix.

1. create a sum variable with intital value as "0"

2. Run a for loop for the number of rows that is from 0 till n.

3. Each row consists of m columns run another loop from 0 till m (nested for loop)

4. Now keep adding all column elements of each row and save it in the sum variable.

5. Once the sum is calculated for the given matrices A and B print the maximum sum between them as result.
