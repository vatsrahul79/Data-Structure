Given number of passengers n,and two arrays of weights of check-in bag and handbags  of n length each

1. As per the question the passenger has to clear both the limits even either of one fails you have to print "Stop"
2. Run a loop over passengers i.e from 0 to n
3. Now check if current check in bag is > 15 or handbag>7 print "Stop" else print "Boarding" beacuse both bags are under limit.
