## Conditional Matrix Sum

You are given a matrix(2-dimensional array) of integers of **n** rows and **m** columns. Your task is to write a program that calculates the sum of all such integers present in the matrix which are divisible by 3.

1. Declare sum variable taking initial value as 0.
2. Given the 2D array with n rows and m columns.
3. Now traverse through each element of the array(Hint: Use nested for loops, run an outer loop from index 0 till n and inner loop from 0 till m)
4. Check if the current element is divisible by 3 if yes keep adding the current element to variable sum.
5. Once all elements are checked print the result saved in the sum variable.
