## Masai Divisors

You are provided 3 integers: *left*, *right* and *k*. Your task is to write a program that finds out the count of all such numbers between *left* and *right* (both inclusive) which are divided by *k*.

1. Take left, right, and k from the given input.
2. Keep a count variable with initial value as 0.
3. Run loop starting from left til right(inclusive) now check if the current value from left to right is divisible by given k
4. If yes increment the count once all values are checked print the result saved in count variable.
